Kevin Bethel Proposal

The positive correlation between Time on Live and Virtual Merchandise Purchases 
indicates that users more engaged with live content are more likely to spend money on virtual goods.
Proposal: If VeloCity X wants to increase sales and revenue they should target users who spend more time on live. 
Based on user behavior, I would also implement a sale on Virtual Merchandise as users are more likely
to make purchases at a discounted rate. 
There is also a positive correlation between the number of sponsorship interactions and virtual merchandise purchases. 
Users who click on more sponsorship ads have a higher intent to engage with offerings like merchandise.
Proposal: Create cross-promotions that link sponsorship interactions with virtual merchandise purchases to increase conversions.
